# 05 Work Day Scheduler

## What is it?

This is a simple scheduler that allows the user to record what their tasks for the
day are going to be between 9am and 5pm inclusive (business hours). The user is given 
the ability to save this information locally to their browser so that the information 
will persist on the next visit.


## Purpose

Allows the user to save important information for each hour for the current day, and 
shows upcoming or past saved information.
